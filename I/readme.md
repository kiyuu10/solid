Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific. Clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use. We can't make a fish climb a tree or dog can lives in the water.
Interface Segregation Principle splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them.
