Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.

objects in the program can be replaced by of their subtypes but do not change the correctness of the program

it extends Open-Closed Principle by focusing on the behavior of a superclass and it's subtypes
